## Data

- All our data was collected from [Naver Place](https://map.naver.com/p/entry/place/1359279525?c=15.00,0,0,0,dh&placePath=/home), a map and restaurant information platform.
- To this end, we developed a crawling code and collected about 350,000 pieces of data.
- The data consists of restaurant, cafe, and bar business names, categories, locations, reviews, dishes, and dish images.

## Recommendation

- [LightGCN](https://github.com/gusye1234/LightGCN-PyTorch) was used to provide recommendation results to users.
- The graph structure was adopted because it can capture overall tastes well in user records.
- Our main function, couple recommendation, inferred the recommendation results by summing each user's embeddings.
- Due to the lack of a quantitative evaluation method for both users, we conducted a survey to more than 100 random people in their 20s and received positive responses from more than 80%.

## Review Analysis

- We used a fine-tuned T5 to summarize a large amount of restaurant reviews.
- Provides a priority sorting function for reviews of users with similar tastes as mine by calculating the similarity between user embeddings.
- This helps users make decisions.

## Deployment

- Implement model serving using FastAPI
- [Model Serving Repo](https://github.com/SJU-Capstone-DS-DayOne/Model_serving)
